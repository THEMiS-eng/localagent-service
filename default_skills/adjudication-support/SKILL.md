# Adjudication Support

UK Statutory Construction Adjudication under HGCRA 1996.

## Adjudication Principles

**Key characteristics:**
- Statutory right (cannot be contracted out)
- Fast: 28 days from Referral (+ 14 days extension)
- Binding until final determination (arbitration/litigation)
- "Pay now, argue later" - cash flow mechanism
- Rough justice accepted
- Enforcement by summary judgment

## Prompt Rewrites

```

### smash and grab | notified sum | payment adjudication
```
Prepare "smash and grab" adjudication:

BASIS: Failure to serve valid Payment Notice / Pay Less Notice

STATUTORY FRAMEWORK:

HGCRA 1996 (as amended) s.111:
- Payment due = notified sum if no valid notices
- Payer must pay notified sum on final date
- Cannot set off or withhold without valid PLN

TIMELINE CHECK:

| Event | Date | Deadline | Actual | Valid? |
|-------|------|----------|--------|--------|
| Application submitted | [date] | - | - | - |
| Payment Notice due | - | [date per contract] | [given/not given] | [Y/N] |
| Pay Less Notice due | - | [date per contract] | [given/not given] | [Y/N] |
| Final Date for Payment | - | [date] | - | - |

VALIDITY ANALYSIS:

Payment Notice:
- Issued by: [party] [correct issuer? Y/N]
- Date issued: [date] [in time? Y/N]
- Sum stated: [amount] [unambiguous? Y/N]
- Basis stated: [Y/N per s.110A requirements]

Pay Less Notice:
- Issued by: [party]  
- Date issued: [date] [in time? Y/N]
- Sum stated: [amount]
- Basis for deduction: [Y/N - must be specific]

REFERRAL:

1. This is a "smash and grab" adjudication seeking payment of the notified sum.

2. The Referring Party's Application No. [X] dated [date] claimed [currency] [amount].

3. The Responding Party failed to issue a valid Payment Notice by [date].
   [Detail failure - none issued / late / defective]

4. The Responding Party failed to issue a valid Pay Less Notice by [date].
   [Detail failure]

5. Accordingly, the "notified sum" for the purposes of s.111 is [currency] [amount], being the sum stated in the Application.

6. The Responding Party has failed to pay the notified sum by the Final Date for Payment ([date]).

DECISION SOUGHT:

(a) A declaration that the notified sum is [currency] [amount]
(b) An order for payment of [currency] [amount]
(c) Interest pursuant to s.111(1) at [rate]

Note: True value / merits irrelevant in smash and grab - Grove v S&T confirmed
```

### adjudication response | réponse | defense
```
Prepare adjudication response:

REFERRAL: [reference, date]
CLAIM: [currency] [amount] / [X] days
RESPONSE DUE: [date]
AVAILABLE TIME: [X] days

RESPONSE STRATEGY:

1. JURISDICTIONAL CHALLENGES

   Consider challenging:
   - [ ] No construction contract
   - [ ] No construction operations  
   - [ ] Dispute not crystallized
   - [ ] Multiple disputes in single referral
   - [ ] Repeat adjudication (same dispute)
   - [ ] Adjudicator not validly appointed

   If challenging: Reserve position but respond on merits
   (to avoid losing substantively if jurisdiction upheld)

2. RESPONSE ON MERITS

   [Follow claims-advocate response template]
   
   Given time constraints, focus on:
   - Killer points only
   - Clear documentary evidence
   - Key weaknesses in claim
   
   Defer complex issues for arbitration with clear reservation.

3. COUNTERCLAIM

   - Counterclaim permitted in response: [check contract/Scheme]
   - Value of counterclaim: [amount]
   - Adjudicator's jurisdiction over counterclaim: [same contract? Y/N]

4. SET-OFF

   - Abatement: [value] [can reduce without notice]
   - Set-off: [value] [needs Pay Less Notice]
   - Cross-claim: [value] [may be separate dispute]

TIMETABLE REQUEST:

If insufficient time:
- Request extension (Adjudicator has discretion for up to 14 days)
- Request permission for Reply
- Identify key documents needed

RESPONSE DOCUMENT:

[Structure as per claims-advocate defense template, adapted for adjudication format and timing]
```

### enforcement | exécution | summary judgment
```
Prepare adjudication enforcement:

DECISION: [Adjudicator name] dated [date]
AMOUNT AWARDED: [currency] [amount]
PAYMENT DUE: [date per decision]
PAYMENT RECEIVED: [none / partial: amount]
OUTSTANDING: [currency] [amount]

ENFORCEMENT ROUTE:

  - Breach of natural justice
  - Adjudicator exceeded jurisdiction
  - Decision not on issue referred
  - Fraud

ENFORCEMENT APPLICATION:

STATEMENT OF TRUTH
[...]
```

### jurisdiction challenge | compétence | Amec v Whitefriars
```
Analyze jurisdiction challenge:

CHALLENGE TYPE:
- [ ] No construction contract (HGCRA s.104)
- [ ] No construction operations (HGCRA s.105)
- [ ] Dispute not crystallized
- [ ] Multi-party / wrong party
- [ ] Multiple disputes (Witney Town Council)
- [ ] Repeat adjudication
- [ ] Adjudicator appointment defective

ANALYSIS:

1. NO CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT

   HGCRA s.104 definition:
   - Agreement for carrying out construction operations
   - Written or evidenced in writing
   
   Excluded (s.104(2)-(5)):
   - PFI/PPP (certain types)
   - Development agreements (certain types)
   - Contracts with residential occupiers
   
   Analysis: [Does contract fall within definition?]

2. NO CONSTRUCTION OPERATIONS

   HGCRA s.105 includes:
   - Building/civil engineering works
   - Fitting out, installation, finishing
   - Site clearance, earthworks
   - Mechanical/electrical installation
   
   HGCRA s.105(2) excludes:
   - Drilling for oil/gas
   - Mining/extraction
   - Nuclear processing
   - Water/effluent treatment
   - Process plant assembly on site
   
   Analysis: [Do works fall within operations?]

3. DISPUTE NOT CRYSTALLIZED

   Requirements:
   - Claim made: [date]
   - Claim rejected or not accepted: [date]
   - Dispute therefore arose: [date]
   
   Risk: If no clear rejection, dispute may not exist.
   
   Analysis: [Evidence of crystallization]

4. STRATEGY

   If jurisdiction challenge strong:
   - [ ] Challenge and not participate on merits
   - [ ] Challenge and participate without prejudice to challenge
   - [ ] Reserve challenge for enforcement
   
   If jurisdiction challenge weak:
   - [ ] Do not challenge - focus on merits
   
   Recommendation: [approach with reasoning]
   
   Note: Court will consider jurisdiction afresh on enforcement (Amec v Whitefriars)
```
