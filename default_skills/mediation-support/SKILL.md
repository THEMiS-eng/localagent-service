### impasse breaking | déblocage | settlement techniques
```
Analyze mediation impasse and options:

CURRENT POSITION:

| Issue | Our Position | Their Position | Gap |
|-------|--------------|----------------|-----|
| [Issue 1] | [X] | [Y] | [Z] |
| [Issue 2] | | | |
| Total | [amount] | [amount] | [gap] |

IMPASSE TYPE:
- [ ] Valuation gap (both have genuine views)
- [ ] Positional (anchored on numbers)
- [ ] Emotional (personal/relationship issues)
- [ ] Structural (authority limits)
- [ ] Information asymmetry

IMPASSE-BREAKING TECHNIQUES:

1. MEDIATOR'S PROPOSAL

Request mediator make a proposal:
- Mediator assesses likely zone and proposes number
- Each party accepts/rejects confidentially
- Only revealed if both accept
- Takes pressure off parties

2. SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE

Current gap: [amount]
Split proposal: [midpoint]

Caution: May not be fair if one side's position more justified. Use only if positions roughly equally defensible.

3. BRACKET NEGOTIATION

"We'll move to [X] if you move to [Y]"

Current brackets: [Our floor] to [Their ceiling]
Proposed new brackets: [Our new offer] conditional on [Their new offer]

4. PACKAGE DEALS

Trade-offs across issues:
- We concede [Issue A] in return for [Issue B]
- Non-monetary elements: [payment terms / reference / ongoing work]

Possible packages:
| Package | We Give | We Get | Net to Us |
|---------|---------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | | | |
| 2 | | | |

5. CONTINGENT AGREEMENTS

If dispute involves uncertain future:
- "If [X happens], payment is [A]; if [Y happens], payment is [B]"
- Shares risk/upside

6. ADJOURNMENT

- Tactical: Let emotions cool, reassess BATNA
- Information-gathering: Get data to break deadlock
- Authority: Obtain higher authority approval
- Deadline pressure: Agree to reconvene with deadline

7. LAST OFFER / FINAL NUMBERS

- Each party gives final confidential number to mediator
- If numbers cross (or close), mediator declares "deal at [X]"
- If far apart, mediator may disclose gap only

8. REALITY TESTING

Ask mediator to reality-test other side on:
- Strength of their case
- Risks if no settlement
- Costs of continued dispute
- Time to resolution

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:

Given the current impasse type ([type]), recommend:

1. [First technique to try]
2. [Fallback technique]
3. [If still stuck: adjourn / proceed to formal ADR]
```
